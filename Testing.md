#  Testing Concerns

* 1. tests will fail if network is unavailable
        * network hiccups
        * network outages
    
* 2. how do I test with a production resource?
    * eg: Twitter:
        * Can't spam tweets (cannot do redundant testing)
        * Don't want to show my tests publicly

* Note: Never test in prod(uction).

## (Testing) Platforms

* PROD - production (where your customers live)
* QA - Quality Assurance
* Dev - Developer
* UAT - User Acceptance Testing (focus group)
* Test - Testing
